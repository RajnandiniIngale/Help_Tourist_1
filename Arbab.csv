"An Unplanned Visit to This Arabian Resto was our best evening so far. Chef Mohd's mouth watering Shish Tawouk, Chicken Wings, Garlic Mayo, Hummus, Authentic Khubbs & Shawarma went in so easily that I refused to have breakfast the next morning."
Stupidest place to go they make water it takes 45 mins to get a water bottle on the table on top of that they take order of humus and after 1 they come down to you stating it is out of stock.

Arbab is a authentic Lebanese food restro located at Waterfield Road in Bandra. We visited the place for weekday quick dinner to try out the hot and cold mezzes. 
"Arbab, located at Waterfield Road in Bandra is one of the authentic Lebanese food resto we visited. It's a small place with outdoor seatings along with live music and screening in the background. The ambience is quite astonishing given its an all open resto. "
Arbab restaurant is located at bandra link road and speciality is Arabian and Lebanese cuisines.sitting arrangements are opendoor sitting.very limited items are available in menu but sufficient enough.
"Arbab means ""master"" in Arabic and the dainty semi-oval shaped restaurant is a venture of three minds - Atiq Kapadia, Fahad and Faiz Kadawalla."
"We love Lebanese food, & we have got another place for our frequent cravings. What a lovely and breezy place. It’s an outdoor seating but made really comfortable & cute"
Arbab is a newly opened place in Bandra. Well it’s affordable and nice place to go for all awarma lovers. Loved it. The cosy ambience makes you like it immediately. 
Go there for the fresh hot Khabus and excellent authentic Humus. Pair this with pickled veggies and Falafels and you have a meal that will transport you to the sand dunes of the Middle East!

Arbab as the name gives you idea about its something like Arab type.It is located at walkable distance from bandra station.The Ambience is good as compare to the place.
"I recently visited this place situated in crux of Bandra. One of the few places who serve middle eastern cuisine. Music presence was too good as well the ambience present was awesome, which will actually make you will as if you are having lunch/dinner"
This review is based on my first visit here. The ambience is good. They have an outdoor seating. The service was good and the server's are polite. My order: 1. The hummus platter: As the name suggests it's 6 different types of hummus. 
"Well I wasn't a fan of lebanese cuisine as such but after having an authentic Lebanese cuisine at this place, I am in love with it. I liked the whole open seating ambience and the light arabic-turkish music being played . "
