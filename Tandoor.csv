t use to be one of the best places but now the hospitality sucks. Arrogance is filled in each staff you see. I had earlier also wrote about it. 
We visited this place looking for non spicy non vegetarian food. They have multiple choices falling in this criteria. We odered Dabba mutton and butter paneer masala.
"Hotel tandoor, Ayodhya park humiliating experinece The staff doesn't know what hospitality means I went today for lunch with one lady engineer who holds a high position in Philips boasting her about Kolhapur's hospitality "
"Food service And hostile staff, neither the Roti was served hot nor was the water in the finger bowl warm."
With a touch of North Indian flavours and recipes Tandoor truely serves some great food !a great variety of typical Kolhapuri food to North Indian tandoori delicacies are served.
"I actually went kolhapur for an exam , once I finished the exam ,i decided to eat something , by referring the reviews i thought it might be better place to eat."
Overpriced. Taste wise good but chicken was smelling. Staff was standing near side station . They were busy in there own gossip. No personal touch..
Non vegetarian specialty dishes ranging from kolhapuri to Punjabi tandoor dishes in very plush ambiance
Nice food here. The kebabs are fantastic. i liked the biryni and chicken gravy too. Godd indian meal here.
Variety of tandoor dishes both veg and non veg this is one of the good places in Kolhapur. Both veg - non veg selection are good.
Was visiting Kolhapur for work. Had meetings the whole day and after that had couple of beers with a colleague. Then we wanted to have dinner and found this place. 
"Tasty food and overall ambiance. The platter size was a bit small but, the taste was really good. Veg food was also good."
Tandoor is first name you might hear when it comes to any non veg hotel in Kolhapur.Biryani is must when here.
While driving towards Mum Goa highway via Kolhapur we had our lunch at Tandoor. This is located in Shivaji Park kolhapur which is easily locatable in google Maps. 
We had gone out to tandoor for dinner with friends . The dishes came real fast. N hot. The quality of food I must say is splendidly fresh. 
Visited many times with family & friends. All non veg dishes which we have tried are good to taste including the sol kadhi.
Its a restaurant with really good food at good prices. I have never been disappointed by the food quality on the few times I have been there. 
Tried this restaurant again recently and the quality of Food was great. Try the Mutton Kheema and Biryani here.A uniques specialty is the Veg Pandhara Rassa which Otherwise is available only in Non Veg across Kolhapur. 
The food here is very very tasty. The prices are bit high but the quantity is more than other hotels. Service is also very good. The no doubt abt the taste of food
I am a regular at this restaurant. I even ask them to deliver food home very often. This Father's Day I happened to visit Kolhapuri Thalis one of their sister concern restaurants situated right next door. 
This is one of the most happening restaurants in Kolhapur now. Known for Punjabi non-veg food. It also has many good vegetarian options. Punjabi food.
"Especially come to Kolhapur for the promise of the real Chicken or Mutton Kolapuri, considered as the most spiciest food of the region, I came to Tandoor."
We visit this restaurant rarely but order parcels on phone. They give quick home delivery. Good clean restaurant. Good ambiance. Either go early or first book table and then go to avoid long waiting
"Restaurant is fully crowded at night time. have to reserve before came. They own two more restaurants in same building. We ordered Veg Khima, Chicken roast, Manchow soup and kulcha in Dinner"
very good food ..specially biryani and tandori chicken.. service was quick and food quality is good
"Menu its not so exotic or give you a feeling of Kholapuri feeling, you will get everything from Mughali to chinese to indian the taste is good"
Very fantastic food. Authentic Kolhapuri style spicy food Not very expensive Had the chicken Angara there. Was mouth watering though very very spicy
Ambiance : OK Service : Average Food Quality : Awesome ( Even the veg dishes are tasty ) We had vegetarian food as we visited this place in navratri. It was highly recommended by local friends and it was truly worth.
"I want to rate 0, but option can not available. Dear Kolhapur brothers don't go in tandoor hotel. I found hair in tandoor biryani. Food quality and behavior of staff, manager and owner was worst. Overall the experience with this hotel is so bad. Dear google developers, I have a request to please provide zero-rating option for review."
biryani is a very good
"The Restaurant belongs to the same owner of Dehati, but unlike Dehati this one offers you Punjabi Cuisine."
Its been done up a lot fancier than when it started off - but the food (quality and taste) have thankfully continued to please. would definitely recommend.
Bad mannered staff especially outside parcel counter person. Food not worth for money. Bad attitude.
"Excellent food, everyone must try chicken patiala as its delicious."
Excellent food quality and management
The best place for tandoor items.
Very Good restaurant in Kolhapur.
Worst food plus worst service
Over priced
Osm hotel

bestest tandoor in the kolhapur  
Definitely worth a visit '' 'Mutton Thali restaurant - you will love the taste but please dont go here expecting a wonderful ambience
