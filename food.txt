 Only thing disappointed this time was the food particularly buffet 
 their was variety but not taste 
 breakfast buffet was still good compare to dinner buffet 
 Room service food tasted amazing but a bit overpriced 
 Buffet breakfast is worth it 
 ] [ 'Stay and dinning were super awesome 
 food quality has decreased now as compared to 
 live counters and courteous staff and chef' 
 The buffet lunch provided is very good and price is also reasonable 
 ] [ 'Everybody from the staff to the cook is very cordial 
 ] [ 'Went for my birthday dinner today 
 good buffet 
Break fast buffet is good with amazing dosas served by Shankar which we choose over eyes 
 That says a lot about the dosa
Dinner buffet is good to but the roasted chicken stood out 
 The best chicken i have had 
 Not oily yet juicy 
 Veg and Non veg 
 I liked Chef Shankar south Indian utappam' 
 ] [ 'Great surrounding and awesome ambience coupled with delicious food and hospitality 
 excellent food quality 
 ] [ 'food was delicious ' 
 ] [ 'food was not delicious '
