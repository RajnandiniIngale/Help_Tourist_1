"We stayed at sayaji for week with 23 month old baby and had a very pleasant experience.the buffet spread was huge ,with excellent prepration, served in personalized and courteous manner. Ambience around pool side with music n singing by Venkatash",business,5,4,
Was pleasing pause to hold you.Good room cleaning&housekeeping.All staff arevery helpfull & gentle.,,,,
"The manager vijay & staff mention name is niraj,arshad ,omkar,ashish ,dheeraj are nice ,helpfull.",,,,
We would reccomend others to visit n stay for sure,,,,
"Service is worst considering 5*, fire safety spaces are occupied for other usages, god knows what will happen in case of emergency. Smell bad sometimes. Room card gets inactivated often, its very inconvenient.",,1,2,1
Hotel has not trained staff for hospitality. Even the managers doesn't seem to be qualified/trained.,,,,
"Recently I stayed here for 1 week. It was a wonderful experience. The best part about the hotel is its staff. Very humle and supportive staff. Thanks to Dodon, Manoj, Snehal and Jyotsna. The dinner buffet is awesome. Amazing time at Turque with friends. The location of hotel is of great convenience.",,5,5,4
It's 5 star hotel. Good for parties. Barbeque nations is at top floor,,5,5,5
"Service and food quality is great, great ambiance.... service is awesome.. specially I am impressed with the service of Rahul salve....who attended me...sayaji helped me to arrange great experience for my daughter's birthday celebration",,5,5,5
Went for buffet lunch on a Sunday with prior reservation.. Bummer was they didn't have a table ready even when they had my details on their list. Had to wait till they managed to arrange one.,family,3,4,
"Food was average, place is very congested, will recommend it only for inhouse guests, for outside bookings, there are much better options",,,,
Wonderful hotel. Their dinner buffet was best in class. A huge variety of both veg and non veg. Breakfast buffet was also free for us and we had a wonderful stay. One of the best stays I have ever had.,business,5,5,5
Efficient operations value for money. Vert courteous staff. The location is not much but convenient for local business visitors.,,4,3,4
Front office staff can be more attentive and polite. Rooms are good. The location has nothing special. The breakfast is very good.,,,,
"I stay 2 night in sayaji pune. I have stayed in all branches of sayaji but in pune service is very poor. No one dropped till room. I Carry my luggage by self both time when checking in and also at times of check-out. After dinner room service was also poor, Before 30 minutes i tell at the counter to complete my bill. But they are not taken it seriously. When i come again at counter again he takes another 10 minutes for bill preparation if u are charging 7000/ per night pl give proper service to the guest",business,1,3,3
Great hotel on Pune-Mumbai highway. Has parking area for vehicles. Spacious rooms and even halls for engagement and birthday parties. Food is delicious ?? and staff is humble and helpful.,,5,4,5
"I must say if your are looking a place to stay or to hangout in pune, near Hinjewadi or Banner, please make sure to select this hotel.",,5,5,4
"Service is A-1, they won't make you to call multiple times for services to it done, you just order and get the thing's done.",,,,
Food : OMG I went to many 5* hotels but no one matched the Sayaji taste. Daily 3 times buffet  multiple options in food and best role is played by food taste.,,,,
They have multiple offers running on corporate or family lunch/dinner events .,,,,
I can guarantee you will not be disappointed by Sayaji ,,,,
"The hotel is located at Mumbai Pune Highway. Has almost all the nice amenities of a 5 star hotel. Rooms are cosy and comfy , food is great and services are excellent . Barbeque Nation is situated on 10th Floor. Ground Floor has buffet restaurant and poolside place is the best. Also a dedicated section the there for hosting marriage functions .",business,4,5,5
Today we visited to celebrate birthday of my sister. Food was good but service was too much worst.,family,1,3,
While serving the main course we had to wait 15 min for each round to serve Indian bread(roti) quality of roti was also not upto mark even dhaba roti quality also better than this.,,,,
When we ordered rice and dal he took 24 min. Approx. To serve. The staff ruined the happiness of our celebration. Food Taste is also SO SO. Road side dhaba/hotels having better taste. The Sayaji brand (terque restaurant) we didn't found upto mark w.r.t 5 star hotel.,,,,
"Disappointed with their service this time. After almost three 3 years visited the place to attend a marriage function. Service guys appear to have taken their guests for granted. With bride n groom sides busy elsewhere, service guys were taking it easy. Refills came only after repeated reminders. And supervisor missing from the spot! One reason I feel was some of servicing guys appear to have not been the trained regulars but brought in to meet emergent requirement. The place with its location, infrastructure, parking, good restaurant food and professional front desk has been a go to place, nonetheless. Please take care, you guys at Sayaji. You have reputation to uphold friends.",,3,5,
We had a family marriage in Sayaji on this 26th evening and the experience was extremely horrible.,family,1,4,
"Hospitality is poor and the management staff are unprofessional. Also the food taste was below average, i wish I could have an option to rate negative.",,,,
"Air Condition was not working leaving us sweating during the whole wedding. We informed the management staff multiple times, but no action was taken.",,,,
Staff behavior and service doesn't match the level of a 5 star hotel at all and it's even below than a normal hotel instead.,,,,
"You better go with another 5 star hotels available around Balewadi as this hotel is not at all recommended for organising family functions like marriage, engagement etc.",,,,
Location is spot on for transit stays.,,1,4,3
The room was clean and comfortable.,,,,
"The staff was spaced out, did not follow instructions and delayed our departure because of missed items we had asked for and confirmed to be packed the previous night itself.",,,,
I was here for a short stay with my family. I must say it was a pleasant and comfortable stay. We booked 2 twin bed rooms with city view (facing the Mumbai-Pune highway) The rooms were clean and nice.,holiday,5,5,5
"The service was prompt and the staff very helpful. The food was too good. If you happen to visit Pune and want a comfortable place to stay not too far from the city center, then this is the hotel for you.",,,,
Highly recommended!,,,,
"I had a great time there to be honest, as it seems most of the reviews done by others are about food quality, rooms, service etc. So I'll skip that part tell you something other than that. There are several events hosted by the hotel and I happen to be at one of such events. Even I was able to look at the once in a life time phenomenon where we can see the undiscovered phase of Saturn. Which happens once in every 78 something years",,4,5,4
