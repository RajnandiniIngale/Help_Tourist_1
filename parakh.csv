"Parakh is another lovely place to.go to, while.in Kolhapur. The veg and special mutton thalis were super yum, and the service quality was super awesome. A 4/5 for food, and a 5/5 for service."
"I had to stop here for food ,r route to Goa .. very tasty meal . I ordered the chicken thali it was very tasty .. it was very crowded but the tables were fast .. the service is very good .. while coming back to Bombay I stopped for lunch again .. the owner is very humble too .."
"Whenever I travel from Mumbai to Kolhapur, I make sure to get lunch halt at Parakh. Awesome food, clean & hygienic place. Unlimited Bhakri, Tambda & Pandhra rassa."
Reasonably tasty food. Bit spicy and tasty.
"Whenever we go to Kolhapur, we visit to Parakh for lunch/dinner. Thats not done, we have visited Parakh only for lunch from Pune. Visited this Sunday, after Corona times! Food was fantastic, red & rassa was too good! Must visit!"
What needs improvement
Although we ordered 2 chicken rice plates. By mistake 1 of these 2 was Mutton plate. Such mistakes must be avoided.
"henever we travel @ kolhapur, we see that we have lunch at Parekh. We like Non Veg food here so that we try again & again."
Hotel Parakh is an iconic restaurant that represents the ever popular Mutton Thali of Kolhapur with tambda and pandhra rassa. This restaurant has huge queue on weekends and you would need to wait atleast 15-20 minutes before you get to experience this.
"Had been to this place liking at the ratings. The place is pretty huge and hence waiting times are considerably less. We ordered mutton thali and found the taste Ok, nothing out of the world. The portion served for mutton war pretty small and mostly bones. The rassa is great though. Overall just an average place by Kolhapur standards."
Hotel Parakh is the best option for Family restaurant also for all..this hotel is on the road of Gandhinagar kolhapur area..we order to muttun fry dish..the food is very tasty..pls visit this hotel
We went for a lunch to have mutton thali... but the quality of mutton was very poor Not at all hygienic place to go with kids
"With sprawling non vegetarian joints, One has to choose from the authentic places. Parakh is one of them. It serves the best Mutton & Chicken varieties. The highloh=ght though is Pandhra Rassa & Tambda Rassa."
It has become a favourite amongst locals as well as tourists Place doesn't bother about ambience but serves one of the best tambda rassa in town. But the quality is doubtful sometimes
"We have lunch at Parakh while returning from tarkarli. This hotel serves mutton, chicken thali. We have tried special mutton and chicken thali. mutton was very well cooked. Pandhara rassa was tasty. Overall good tasty food."
Must eat here...especially the mutton thali.. The guys working here are also so hospitable and eager to help..typical kholhapuri hospitality.. That we experienced in a lot of places here
" I had mutton fry thali which costs around 250 which includes 3 chapati , mutton fry, kheema, two types of gravy. Taste is OK but not great."
Hotel parakh is good hotel in kolhapur. Some new and tasty dishes are here. So come here and enjoy your day.
"I got this place through google trips, wherein it had a very high ratings. And yes, those high ratings were not without any reason. The food was simply delicious. It had the local flavor and was satisfying. Will definitely return.."
Typical kolhapuri speciality in non Vegeterian food especially goat/lamb meat delicaies on Thali system with Tambda/Pandhara Rassa.
I will suggest this place to have authentic non veg food of Kolhapur. Food is great. Even veg option is available but it is just ok. Seating arrangement could be made better.
"One of budget eating joints in kolhapur, there nonveg mutton thali with bhakri and T & P rassa is very good, but bad solkadhi served. The very large average eating joint and economical place. This place need not be must in your iteneri."
"Very good food, nice service. Mutton thali is very good, pure mutton they serve and famous for pandra rassa. Only cleanliness is required. Otherwise awesome place"
Best non-veg location inside kolhapur when travelling on Pune Bengaluru highway. Best pandhra- tambda non-veg rassa speciality point.
Best place to taste Authentic Kolhapuri treat. We tried both Mutton and Chicken Thali. Tambda n pandhara rassa are awesome.
Had heard a lot about this place. Had a mutton Thali costs Rs 240. Surprisingly it's not at all heavily spiced. And easy on the stomach. A rare achievement for a restaurant. Good taste.
"Parakh serves great mutton thali. service is very good and quick, place is crowded during peak hours."
"The quality of food and the taste of the thali offered is of no match with some of the finest in the city! Just love the mutton thali, have been visiting every year when I visit the city!"
"Awesome veg-non-veg thalis, they are just too tasty. "
"Parakh had almost closed down when we arrived. Upon requesting them that we have arrived from Nagpur by road and are keen to taste their food, they happily obliged."
Best place to visit for traditional Kolhapuri delicacies.. Tambda Rassa and pandhra rassa.. And to add mutton or chicken sukha.. 
I visited this hotel more than 50 times its special for mutton thali & chicken thali....if u visit kolhapur than u should try this hotel
"This restaurant has a tradition to serve its customers with the NEVER CHANGING, CONSISTENT, AUTHENTIC, DELICIOUS Kolhapuri Mutton. Most people think ""Kolhapuri is Spicy"", which is absolutely wrong. "
The mutton thali was awesome & priced reasonably. Chicken & veg thali was strictly average. Don't forget the solkadi which was awesome. We must have at least 4 glasses each.
"if you are non veg food lover, this is the best place to visit. What a taste. Enjoy Tambada Rassa and Pandhara Rassa."

this place is very good in kolhapur. it was an amazing hotel in kolhapur  
Definitely worth a visit Mutton Thali restaurant - you will love the taste but please dont go here expecting a wonderful ambience. It is a very simple and no frills place and the only attraction is the food.
