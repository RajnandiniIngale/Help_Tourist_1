reviews
Best food for vegetarian have daily different type of food everyday
Rates are on higher side. If I had to pay so much high price here then I would prefer staying in a 5 star hotel instead. Also I felt it's an old property which needs renovation very badly

"Its pure vegan hotel. Average service. But the garden view is pretty cool. But i m disappointed about the architectural design of ground floor.Hotel have Amenities like pool table, table tanis and garden.
But if you want budget stay than i will suggest about it."
Amazing Hospitality and service. Great food and restaurant experience.
"Though a nice scenic hotel, but worst service. Always after money, money and money. On our last trip to mahabaleshwar we stayed at this place. Even after having 150 rooms in this hotel there is no power backup, no maintenance of indoor games, no wifi, no mobile networks."
"Very decent property with decently maintained rooms, courteous staff. They have a well maintained swimming pool. View from room balcony is very good especially during sunrise. Ample parking space. Situated on main road yet no noise pollution. If travelling with 3-4 people, then try their cottage rooms."

"Visited here with family, super deluxe rooms could be better. Loved the veg food although I am a hardcore non vegetarian. You can always other non veg food from the main market and will be delivered to your room.Great hospitality and great location."
Breakfast was not so good. But lunch and dinner was good. Good for couple as well as family.Pleasent view from balcony.
"Lovely place to visit we went there just to check but rooms seemed spacious also there was no hotel smell which generally is there in hotels huge property lovely entrance vintage look..also vintage artefact separate indoor game section. Lovely flowers and trees around only one drawback that there are many monkeys around...
But over all good place to stay.
Bit away from mahableshwar market
Need personal vehicle
Beautiful landscapes and scenery."
"It was a fabulous experience to us.

Fresh food.

Calm place.
Supporting staff.
Garden is very good.
We liked it personally."
The hotel is conveniently to travel and my overall experience was awesome. The surrounding and hospitality was really good. The staff were very friendly and professional in services and the room provided was very good and maintained in clean condition with all the necessary facilities. My stay at this hotel was peaceful as it was a relaxation trip.
"Not a nice experience compared to the reviews, food depends on customers, if more customers are staying in normal rooms then the food is normal local dishes and if more people are staying in luxurious[just for name] rooms then the standard of food is like hotel dishes.
Pool is just built to attract customers, it's not authentic planned build, but just to fill in the empty space available. No proper ventilation in toilets and for room service, we have to personally contact the desk for room service.
Expect for gardens and outlook of hotel everything inside is of 1 star hotel. Nothing interesting. And also no proper network after reception area. So if your room is on inner side,then you will practically have to come outside."
"One of the best hotel. Food quality is great. Service is superb. Very good in hospitality.

Very clumsy walk way to rooms and unhygienic. Won't recommend anybody to go to this place. Room rent 5k.
"Oh my god I just fell in love with PARKYARD it's such a beautiful place to live even if you don't go out in mahableshwar for shopping or other things you can truly have peace, calmness, fun inside ."
Excellent property.co-operative staff. Very big swimming pool ambience
"Had very bad experience. Rooms are very expensive when compared to prices, old construction needs a lot of improvement. Food quality was also bad. Most worst thing was the Night duty manager very arrogant and don't know how to behave with the guests. We definitely won't recommend this place to any one."
"The hotel operates with different names: They have Hotel Parkyard written in the hotel and Park Plaza written in the net.. The hotel has a large area and offers good view from the room. But I would give a rating of 2 coj the hotel is not properly maintained and the room stinks. The bed probably has bed bugs. The place does not have any mobile network connectivity from the rooms. You get wifi access only in reception areas not in the rooms."
"The hotel is proclaimed to be a 4 star. The name on their board is Parkyard. Here's what you need to know before booking:
- vodafone/jio/airtel/idea network is nearly nonexistent, and when present, fluctuates.
- hot water in the tap is only available 7-10 AM (they will provide hot water buckets later, but it takes too long and is barely sufficient)
- swimming pool timings are 9-1 & 2-6 only. Too shallow for grown people. Monkeys are known to take a dip here too.
- there is no grill or net on the windows even though there are many monkeys in the area
- the night manager is exceedingly rude, and unashamed for his behaviour. Do not expect even the slightest help from him.
- the little food and beverages we had was not well made at all.
- if you by any chance get a discount, be prepared to give up basic room amenities, like toiletries. Moreover, there is no exhaust in the bathrooms.
- all linens were either soiled, torn, or smelly."
"I went there with my friends in NOV 2016. We booked Mahabaleshwar package tour and out of many other options I chose this one. Park Plaza is 2 km away from Mahabaleshwar market and local rickshawala charges straight 100 Rs (how far ur hotel is doesn‚Äôt matter its fix rate :P ) anyways ‚Ä¶ so we arrived early in the morning Hotel staff is very polite helpful and responsible. We booked std rooms but rooms were clean and tidy.
They have garden, swimming pool (swimming costume is compulsory), indoor games (like chess, TT and carrom) and space to watch sunset. property is quite big and well maintained. Since its away from Market u feel quiet and peaceful here.
Hotel Service ‚Äì very good. You will get a call for lunch/dinner/breakfast. Hot water is available in the morning. Every room has a private balcony, TV. Last day we were in hurry so they sent breakfast to our room.
Food- they prepare only veg items and limited variety but thr food is not bad. Morning breakfast is good. While returning from sightseeing you can get down at market and eat whatever u want.
Its very nice place. We enjoyed a lot and will definitely visit again."
Good place for weekend but not for the weekdays... friendly staff good food for Vegetarians.. nice stay
Establishment is a retired veteran... feels like Once upon a time used to be a grand palace... But now due to lack of maintenance it's literally stinks... But good service and decent food... In season it offers good view of the valley
Food is great. Room service is good. Need to improve room interior and essential services much more. Environment friendly.
"Nice location and courteous staff. Food is pure veg with decent taste. Games like carrom, chess & TT available."

Some drawbacks : very far from market - around 2 km, hot water available only in morning"
