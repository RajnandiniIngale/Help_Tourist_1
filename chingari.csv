Good restaurant.
I can't think of a better way to cap off a day of sightseeing than great food and that's what Chingari provides. Rahul and Vishwanath were our hosts for the night and were always present anytime we required anything and were very helpful with their recommendations. The food was delicious and if there was one recommendation I could make it would be the Chakunder ki galouti.

Amazing food and warm hospitality by chef Harmeet Singh. He suggested food based on our requirements. The food was prepared with perfection and served with love!
Great ambiance. Very good food. Friendly staff.
"Best dinning place, we really loved the gentle of gesture of the head chef, who made sure to attend all the guests at time intervals fo a small chit chat over the experience and food served."
Absolutely fantastic experience. Chef Hemant and his staff is super awesome. My father had an upset stomach and he wanted plain non spicy food. Chef Hemant specially prepared plain dal and dry sabzi for him outside the set menu. My dad loved it. We had ordered chicken roganjosh and bharwaan alu. Extremely flavorful with optimum spice. The service was great too. Definitely recommend this place.
"We had a lovely time at Chingari! The atmosphere was lovely and the food was exceptional. However, the winner that night was the service. Talented chefs, accommodating waiting staff, and a warm welcome is what we experienced here. We even got a congratulatory cake that the staff got together and baked for us. Truly a lovely experience and some of the best authentic Indian cuisine I've tasted in a while.

"As expected it was a five-star experience.  If you are going then please do ask for chef Harmeet, he is an awesome cook and extremely nice  man. we just trusted him and everything that  came on our table was mind-blowing.   Ambiance,  staff, food everything was perfect. We went there to have our anniversary dinner  and guys over there didn't let any stone unturned to make it more special."
Excellent service. Very professional. Food is excellent. Definitely recommend!
Wonderful decor and great food. Good for a fine dine evening
"Chingari is one of the restaurants in Le Meridien, Mahabaleshwar. We were treated to some delicious food by Chef Harmeet. Excellent service and good portion of food served. We had beetroot galouti, dal makhni and kulcha (all of these were lip smacking). Dal makhni was the best of the lot. Unfortunately, could not try other food items on the menu. Left with fond memories and a wonderful taste in our mouths. Worth visiting if you are in Mahabaleshwar. 5 start restaurant in the true sense."
"Highly disappointed, visited twice but hard luck, returned from the gate, that's very humiliating. They don't allow outsiders to the restaurant, I reckon, which by the way is mentioned no where. Never receive calls or return calls, so as to make a prior reservation. Being from the hospitality industry, not at all cordial or welcoming."
We were here for dinner & loved the ambience. Nice music added to the dim lighting. We'd Dum Ki Biryani (Prawns); it was delicious. Our server made us feel at home & was a pleasant fellow to chat with.
"Excellent restaurant for Indian food at Le Meridien. Prices are on the high side as expected in a 5 star resort. But the food and service is worth it. For the non vegetarians, chicken lababdar is a great one. Try not to miss eating here."
Great ambiance. Very good food. Friendly staff.
This restaurant had the best dal makhani I have ever had! Every bit was so sumptuous and savoury I couldnâ€™t compare it with any ! The appetisers were also good! The food is pricey but you get what you pay for! The dal makhani truly steals the show!
