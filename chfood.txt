 My dad loved it 
 We had ordered chicken roganjosh and bharwaan alu 
 Extremely flavorful with optimum spice 
 The service was great too 
 The atmosphere was lovely and the food was exceptional 
 Talented chefs 
 We even got a congratulatory cake that the staff got together and baked for us 
 Truly a lovely experience and some of the best authentic Indian cuisine I 've tasted in a while
 If you are going then please do ask for chef Harmeet 
 he is an awesome cook and extremely nice man 
 we just trusted him and everything that came on our table was mind-blowing
