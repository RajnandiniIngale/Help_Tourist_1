"One of the best place in Mumbai for Italian cuisine. Be it Service or Ambiance or the menu spread especially for vegetarian like me, you shall love and like everything."
"This is the place you need to go, when it comes to Italian food! Really liked the way they represent and creates the vibe we need. Great cocktails and amazing ambience. They also have CinCin aperitivo hours basically happy hours from 4-7pm."
"Cin Cin like it's neighbor is another hyped up restaurant. The food menu while varied was uninspiring, and a bit all over the place. I could not make out what its real focus was. "
"Beware, despite showing you a wide variety of whiskies in the bar menu everything except 2 or 3 super premium and very expensive brands of whiskey are ""Not Available""."
"From the house of K A Hospitality we have CinCin their first homegrown Italian restaurant in the very same premises as Yauatcha and Nara Thai. CinCin is reasonably priced despite the location and it's very sexy, chic and soothing decor. "
Excellent restaurant at BKC. Being Vegetarian all the ordered items are veg . Tried House Red wine is very good. Truffle Fries are majestic. bruschetta & aracini rice balls are excellent Main course Pizza Florentine and Lasagna di fungi both are dam good. 
"Centrally located. Has both open and closed sitting area. Were a big group as such were not able to get a place in the open area, which we would have preferred. "
Located on the ground floor in the prime BKC. Has a large outside seating area and very nice ambience and service. Loved the risotto.
Located in the BKC area complex of 3 restaurant with fine dining this caters to Italian more. Service is good. Tad pricey. Food ok. Maintains social distancing norms with contactless menu.
"The food at CinCin is yummm. We had the tomato bruschetta, the pasta in vodka sauce, the agnolotti, a vegetarian pizza and mushroom risotto and they were all delicious. We really enjoyed eating here."
An afternoon lunch to send of a colleague turned to be a delightful exercise in visiting the first dine out post unlock down . 
"If you are going during winters, I recommend having a seat on the outside of the restaurant. It is an Italian joint which pizzas which means you can find a lot of delicious pizzas and pasta on the menu. "
"We did not have a booking but were able to get a table for early dinner. We ordered food for the children in our group first and went through the menu, which offered a good selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options."
"The place was super busy, staff very friendly and the barkeeper amazing. He knew what I wanted before I did :), and he was right. "
CinCin which is located at BKC is one of the best Italian joints in the city of Mumbai. There are some great Italian food options which thankfully hasn't been Indianized to suit the local palette.
"CinCin offers a beautiful ambience, scrumptious food and great service. Highly recommend the garlic bread, pizza and spaghetti arrabbiata. A must try place!!"
"On a rainy day, with the floral roof and great food..it was my first visit and was worth it. accessible location and plenty of seating..only the restroom is a rather long walk."
Expect authentic Italian here and not our desi varieties of the dishes. The homemade pastas and the pizza are quite amazing.
A true Italian joint serving all the Italian specialities some of which I have never hear of before. 
Had gone for a business meeting in the evening. Weather permitting had sat in the open. Nice and quite place. Reasonably priced. Only let down was the waiters were too pushy and were unnecessary suggesting. 
"I guess what they say location location location really matters for cincin, These guys in terms of service are a far cry from even a two star Restaurant. The server to our table just left a bottle or water without asking what we wanted. "
"A family lunch at CinCin- was excellent! Great stuff- we had 3 different types of Pizzas, Ravioli, Rissotto, Spaghetti Aglio Olio. Tiramisu was out of the world!TTTiramisu is to die"
"Quite nice staff. It’s a rarity. They accompany you to the table. The waiter comes over and speaks with confidence about the food, and converses as if we were talking from long back. The chicken dish was nice. "
"Visited CinCin with a dear friend and I absolutely loved the ambience! The pizza was well made, authentic with subtle flavours, loved the mocktails, and the Panna Cotta was to die for!!! "
Cold ham slices on top of the pizza! Bitter taste in the mouth for several hours..
Beautiful ambience and lovely staff. The ceasar salad is outstanding. Music and service adds to the beauty of the space.
Jain food option very less. Veg also limited without mushrooms. Overall not happy with value for money. 
Highly unsatisfied with the hospitality brought to us during the course of service at this place . 
One more addition to the list of the best Italian restaurants in Mumbai. Loved the ambience and the portion size served as per their pricing was truly fair. Quick service and amazing taste. Totally in love with their Wood_fired pizzas. 
CinCin (pronounced as ChinChin) is a restaurant with great Italian food and a special menu for those who are crazy for Truffle.
The food was well prepared but quite pricey. Truffle prices as garnish were exorbitant. Simple things like beer should be served chilled and they couldn’t manage for a while. The red wine sangria was loaded with cinnamon and that killed it for me. 
"Came here for my birthday dinner after having eaten elsewhere- never have I regretted not being able to eat more! We had a Burrata salad, truffle fries and the tagliolini between the two of us, and we wiped everything CLEAN. "
This was my 2nd visit in less than a week. The first time was for lunch with a work colleague. We dropped in for a late quick lunch. I had the Chitarra Cacio E Pepe. It was excellent.
We went to celebrate a birthday at lunchtime to avoid the evening traffic as it’s a one hour daytime drive for us. Large spacious space with sitting area outside. We had booked a table in advance and reached just before the lunchtime crowd. 
Enjoyed the evening at CinCin mainly because of the outside seating and soothing music. To find a cosy place like this in Mumbai is difficult. The outside seating cannot be reserved so you will need to go a bit early.
"This place might be the best Italian restaurant in BKC . Ambience is average , they have both indoor and outdoor seating, always full at lunch time, but their food is really good if you order wisely . "
"We visited CIn Cin for lunch . The lace serves up some great Italian food. The service I found super efficient, professional and very attentive. "
"This restaurant was buzzing with crowd and people were in queue for getting a table. They offer very nice pizzas, hand rolled pastas and have good collection of wines. "
Wanted to go since a long time finally went there yesterday big fan of Yautcha and Nara also this place holds a special place coz I celebrated my 40th 4 years back at the same place
