"""I was informed that this hotel room's washroom is wheelchair accessible, I called and asked also but when we checked in the hotel room, the washroom was not accessible at all. I was very disappointed."""
lots of traffic noise in room. TV in room donot have balance to view. corridor are not cleaned. poorly cleaned windows. Ac not working properly
The well located property. Access to airport and nice market nearby. Metro station is walkable. Value for money.
Located close to International Airport- just 2.5 km. Around 5-6 km from domestic airport. Room size is decent. Room was neat and clean. Check in was prompt.
Hotel rooms are small yet in good condition. bathrooms are clean. the one thing which i like the most is that it very close to international airport T2. Silver inn is in marol naka and this high traffic area so it may take long
