 [ [ 'This is the place you need to go 
 Great cocktails and amazing ambience 
 and a bit all over the place 
 ' ] [ `` From the house of K A Hospitality we have CinCin their first homegrown Italian restaurant in the very same premises as Yauatcha and Nara Thai 
 CinCin is reasonably priced despite the location and it 's very sexy 
 Tried House Red wine is very good 
 Were a big group as such were not able to get a place in the open area 
 Has a large outside seating area and very nice ambience and service 
 ' ] [ 'The place was super busy 
 ' ] [ `` CinCin which is located at BKC is one of the best Italian joints in the city of Mumbai 
 There are some great Italian food options which thankfully has n't been Indianized to suit the local palette 
 '' ] [ 'CinCin offers a beautiful ambience 
 scrumptious food and great service 
 pizza and spaghetti arrabbiata 
 A must try place 
 with the floral roof and great food 
 accessible location and plenty of seating 
 Nice and quite place 
 ' ] [ ' I guess what they say location location location really matters for cincin 
 These guys in terms of service are a far cry from even a two star Restaurant 
 ' ] [ 'Visited CinCin with a dear friend and I absolutely loved the ambience 
 loved the mocktails 
 ' ] [ 'Beautiful ambience and lovely staff 
 Music and service adds to the beauty of the space 
 Veg also limited without mushrooms 
 Overall not happy with value for money
 ' ] [ 'Highly unsatisfied with the hospitality brought to us during the course of service at this place 
 ' ] [ 'One more addition to the list of the best Italian restaurants in Mumbai 
 Loved the ambience and the portion size served as per their pricing was truly fair 
 ' ] [ 'CinCin ( pronounced as ChinChin ) is a restaurant with great Italian food and a special menu for those who are crazy for Truffle 
 Truffle prices as garnish were exorbitant 
 The first time was for lunch with a work colleague 
 ' ] [ 'We went to celebrate a birthday at lunchtime to avoid the evening traffic as it â€™ s a one hour daytime drive for us 
 Large spacious space with sitting area outside 
 We had booked a table in advance and reached just before the lunchtime crowd
 To find a cosy place like this in Mumbai is difficult 
 The outside seating can not be reserved so you will need to go a bit early 
 ' ] [ 'This place might be the best Italian restaurant in BKC 
 always full at lunch time 
 The lace serves up some great Italian food 
 ' ] [ 'Wanted to go since a long time finally went there yesterday big fan of Yautcha and Nara also this place holds a special place coz I celebrated my 
 years back at the same place\xa
