 We ordered mutton thali and found the taste Ok 
 ' ] [ 'Hotel Parakh is the best option for Family restaurant also for all 
 the food is very tasty 
 pls visit this hotel ' ] [ 'We went for a lunch to have mutton thali 
 but the quality of mutton was very poor Not at all hygienic place to go with kids ' ] [ 'With sprawling non vegetarian joints 
 It serves the best Mutton & Chicken varieties 
 ' ] [ `` It has become a favourite amongst locals as well as tourists Place does n't bother about ambience but serves one of the best tambda rassa in town 
 But the quality is doubtful sometimes '' ] [ 'We have lunch at Parakh while returning from tarkarli 
 chicken thali 
 We have tried special mutton and chicken thali 
 Pandhara rassa was tasty 
 Overall good tasty food 
 Some new and tasty dishes are here 
 The food was simply delicious 
 ' ] [ ' I will suggest this place to have authentic non veg food of Kolhapur 
 Even veg option is available but it is just ok 
 there nonveg mutton thali with bhakri and T & P rassa is very good 
 Otherwise awesome place ' ] [ 'Best non-veg location inside kolhapur when travelling on Pune Bengaluru highway 
 Best pandhra- tambda non-veg rassa speciality point 
 ' ] [ 'Best place to taste Authentic Kolhapuri treat 
 Good taste 
 Definitely worth a visit '' ] [ 'Mutton Thali restaurant - you will love the taste but please dont go here expecting a wonderful ambience
