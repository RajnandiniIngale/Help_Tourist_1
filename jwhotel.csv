"Jw marriott juhu is a must-visit if you want to feel all the luxury. The location is perfect. It gives you city life, as well as beach life, feels. The hospitality here makes the stay more relaxed. The food was just delicious. You can enjoy the serene infinity sea view from the rooms here. It's a perfect place to stay in the mumbai city."
"Amazing ambience, food and location"
"Great propperty, great staff, great food"
"Great location, food and the ambience, loved the pool area which is next to beach"
"Beauty around every corner of the hotel. The room, even a basic one, is very well equipped and very comfortable, especially the bathroom area is beautifully designed and the shower head is nice and big. Although the standard food court is massively overpriced (2-3 times a normal restaurant) it's actually lower quality food. Disappointing"
Very nice good ambience good food very well maintained
Food quality was very good. And room decorationfor anniversarywas also very good.

"Very cooperative staff, excellent service"
The saty was comfortables. The hospitality was amazing.
Stay was comfort and little bit mashup in check in and checkout.
Breakfast was amazing
"I was at the pool and fancied a cold beer but I was told that you don't serve alcohol at the pool side because you don't have an alcohol licence for the pool side. This is ridiculous, it's a 5 star hotel and the pool is on the hotel property so why should you need another alcohol licence which is separate from the hotel alcohol licence."
Breakfast was not included in the rate
Staff was very accommodating especially Ms Muskan who handled a misunderstanding on the room allocation very well and also the staff at Dashanzi were very friendly and Chef Gaurav even surprised me with an amazing vegetarian Dumpling and Sushi platter for Dinner.
"Reception, not cusomer focused"
"Beautiful ambience, the hotel had character to it . The room decor and the staff's pampering made the occasion more special. Am happy I chose your property to celebrate"
the room was very small and ongoing construction caused some inconvenience.
Repairing work noise
Good range of breakfast can improve on range of fresh fruit juices
breakfast and dining...incredible
Never ordered breakfast in the room Rooms of 3 bed perfect with its bathrooms… Never had dinner so no idea ….
Breakfast is mega. The breakfast area is the size of a football pitch. It has everything for everyone's taste.
"breakfast lobby was too noisy and unstructured, access to beach from hotel could have been separated, room amenities felt old, bathroom has been leaking"
The rooms and amenities are great.
Nothing to dislike.
Great Hotel with lots of space and good facility. Well maintained Pool and restaurants.
We had a wonderful time at the hotel and I would definitely visit again.
Cleanliness was exceptional. Staff was extremely helpful and kind. Thank you
