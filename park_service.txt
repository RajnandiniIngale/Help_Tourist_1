 Average service 
 ' ] [ 'Amazing Hospitality and service 
 but worst service 
 courteous staff 
 people 
Great hospitality and great location 
 ' ] [ 'It was a fabulous experience to us
\r\nSupporting staff
 The surrounding and hospitality was really good 
 The staff were very friendly and professional in services and the room provided was very good and maintained in clean condition with all the necessary facilities 
 if more customers are staying in normal rooms then the food is normal local dishes and if more people are staying in luxurious [ just for name ] rooms then the standard of food is like hotel dishes
 No proper ventilation in toilets and for room service 
 we have to personally contact the desk for room service
 Service is superb 
 Very good in hospitality
co-operative staff 
 Most worst thing was the Night duty manager very arrogant and do n't know how to behave with the guests 
 but it takes too long and is barely sufficient ) \r\n- swimming pool timings are 
 Too shallow for grown people 
\r\n- there is no grill or net on the windows even though there are many monkeys in the area\r\n- the night manager is exceedingly rude 
 Do not expect even the slightest help from him
