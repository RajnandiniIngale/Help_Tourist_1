"This place is better known as the New Palace Museum. It houses many of the Kolhapur Maharaja's paintings, arms, furniture and other memorabilia. One can also see the durbar hall. Unfortunately, photography is prohibited inside the museum. "
"which has been built in 1888 on the designs of Mant. The Palace is a mix of Rajasthani , Gujarati and Jain style of Architecture.The site is open on all days except Mondays, from 9.30 AM to 6.00 PM."
Good to see the palace. Things out there which was displayed. Old weapons. Got to learn some past history.
"Kolhapur New Palace, 2 km north of the city center, was completed in 1881 by the project of Major Charles Manta, who connected the European, Jain, Hindu and Islamic elements here, creating an architectural style that became famous Indo-Mauritanian."
"Beautiful Palace! Nice museum of historical items, furniture,photographs, wildlife & arms etc.Palace n surrounding area is beautiful..neat n clean! Ample space for parking.Small garden in front of palace is well maintained."
Best of my life I see this type of place for the fast time & I like it I always wnt to see old places & like to kw hw peoples livings
"Also known as the New Palace, this iconic place is located around 3.5 km from the main bus stand/ station...you can reach here by local bus or by an auto ..auto drivers are known to rip you (many have altered meter)."
"Interesting fact about this palace is that the family of the SAHU family resides inside the part of the palace at presenta nd another part of the palace is open for public as museum in which many thinks kept for display like furniture, Jwellery, Preserved animal parts etc. "
"We went for an hour recently . The place is on the heart of City. Well maintained and covers almost all the aspects of life of Sahuji Maharaj . Be it his clothes, weapons, furnitures etc . Nice place to visit and spend 1.5-2 hours . Don't miss if you are in Kolhapur. "
"Too crowded, no ventilation and not a well maintained museum. They have so many good and antique things but no information was provided about the antiques kept. The entry and exit was same which made things worse."
While it is a must visit place the upkeep and maintenance is poor. Some of the displays are crude and the edifice crumbling. There is enough here though to keep you fascinated.
"An amazing collection of weapons that even the PUBG kids show an interest in, greet you at this palace. Those were the times!"
This is a good place to visit once in life. It remembers about history and we get information about historical things
"This is the best palace in kolhapur. It's superb maintenance overall building, Maharastra Rullers are different. Especially Shivaji Empire is an excellent period in Indian History. "
Palace is located 3km away from Kolhapur city centre.It was constructed between 1877–1884.The whole building is eight-angled and has a tower in the middle. The clock on it was fixed in 1877. 
"I could like to thank Sahu ji maharaj royal family for maintaining such a beautiful palace, this will help the generation to know which weapons were used in the war & how the life style of kings during those days, its good that this is under Royal family."
This is one of the highlights of a visit to Kolhapur. It used to be the residence of the Maharaja Chhatrapati Shahuji but the first floor is now a museum. The royal family still live upstairs.
"This should have been the highlight of my trip to Kolhapur, but was very disappointing. Firstly they ask you to take off your shoes and there is no secured place for putting them. "
Entry fee 35 RS pp.The best palace I have seen so far. Entire building is kept in superb condition.Museum inside palace is amazing.
The prime tourist attraction of the town is New Palace (is actually not new :D ). It was constructed between 1877–1884. They took 35 rs entry fee at the gate. My suggestion is please visit this place in the morning. 
Historic place. Must visit. Please take care of transportation. Going back is painful if you don't have vehicle. We walked like more than a km.
"Located in a secluded green area of Kolhapur, the palace converted into museum was a pleasant surprise. As you enter the palace gate, you will for sure miss the office where tickets need to be bought. So make a point to buy them. 30/- per person."
Located around 2 km form Kolhapur Station this Palace has a Museum within.Photos are not allowed.
The museum is average. With some generic exhibit s. I did nit find anything that was very different or special/specific to the king.My kid was inspired by the swords and rifles though.
"This palace is really nice indo-british architectural design. The palace's museum has good collection of animals (although dead) , but it still managed to amaze my 3 year old. "
Go there when you have a little free time to see some history. They'll show you a lot about the crazy life rich people had back then!
If you want to visit some old and Royal things in kolhapur Royal Palace is best Option. You can come here with your family.
"While my kolhapur visit I visited Mahalaxmi temple , Shahuji chhatrapati Museum. It was good historical meseum . We can see so many weapons like swards , arroows , & so many other weapons. It will take 1 to 2 hrs to cover the meseum ."
Nothing much h to write about as nothing extraordinary for you if u have been to other such h museums and yes quite well. Maintained
please visit it a worth sight seeing quaint place. Its very clean and has peacocks and many varieties if birds around. 
During my visit in Kolhapur I visited the Shahuji Chhattapati museum. I didn’t enter the museum since I got a wrong ticket. However the building was worth seeing. 
Al rooms are equipped with historic materials. Specially last rooms give u idea about weapons.very big collection of weapons. 
"Just the same as other. Museums, relics of shivaji Maharaj, shahuji Maharaj etc all there.. A must visit if with family and. Kids."
"Beautiful well-architectured and well-maintained palace. You can watch things used by Maharaj like weapons, costumes, hunted and stuffed various animals, the beautiful hall, antique accessories. etc"
Beautiful palace of ancient Indian. The place is in very good surroundings. The area is very nice and beautiful.
Very beautiful and awesome place to visit with children. The place provides a great day with knowledge to children.
"For history lovers..it is well maintain, need only 1 hour..not big but in kolhapur,top tourist attraction."
Nice place to visit.
"This is a nice palace. You can see the things used by Maharajas like weapons, dresses, jewellery, furnitures, animals hunted by them, Majestic Durbar hall."
