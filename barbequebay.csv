"The experience was awesome.
The arrangement done by Mr. Manas and Mr. Sukhdeb for our birthday was so good it made our day special.
Also, special thanks to Ms. Deepali at Fasal, Avijit for helping with our food cravings.
Finally Miss Nisha has ensured that our stay in the resort was memorable and pleasant in all respects
Kudos team Saj."
"Decent experience if u want to try something different than the routine..

Otherwise (except for price) doesn't stand up to BBQ nation or so ..

Not many choices... Starters were fine. Main course or sweets were not great

Live music was good... 1 star was for him only ..

But still a fair family experience"
Limited parking available on premises
Wonderful dinner at saj mahabaleshwar... Barbecue and grills at this restaurant with buffet was tasty... Service was warm and great hospitality... Good live music. Special mention to Mr. Avijit and Mr. Raj for their concern and help. Thank you.
"I was visiting club mahindra with family and we wanted to try this out. I must say the barbecue was quite delicious, and so was the rest of the spread. They had a dozen barbecue options veg and nonveg both. Really enjoyed and Palash took extra care that we had a great time."
Everything top notch was there yesterday and loved it and would specially say comparing to last year when we came the spread of food and the taste has gone top notch towards level up way way better then last year loved it a lot.
"Horrible experience, staff is under extreme pressure to meet sales targets and are giving fake bills. Really disheartened as this is part of Mahindra Group, and not expected at all from such a reputed brand."
Best experience.. delicious food..eat too much.. thanks.. enjoyed food.. please everyone must take experience.. thanks chef palash for best service
"One of the most overpriced eateries in Mahabaleshwar. In short they failed badly while trying to copy and implement BBQ nation or Absolut Barbecue experience as well as taste. Dinner for two costed 3k. The starter taste were bland, the buffet spread doesn‚Äôt have much option,Overpriced drink, No live counter. To sum off, avoid this place and try other restaurants."
Excellent food and service provided‚Ä¶ one of the best restaurants for dine out in Mahabaleshwar.
Good food  they one more option for buffet dinner you can check that one also
"Ambience, Music and Food is great .. an experience you should definitely try if you love grills."
Great time ‚ù§Ô∏è
Very costly and food was ok. Service is very slow.
"Food was good with iive music in rain . I enjoyed a lot .
Abhijeet , Narshing & Shake gave us good service.
Thanks."
Good service and ambience. enjoyed barbeque spread
Half the quality and more than double the price. If you are looking for experience similar to Bbq nation and other similar joints then you will be disappointed. You will be disappointed when the bill is almost double per person for half the quantity and quality. Instead explore local delicacies around the town.....
Best dinner I had in my Life at Barbecue Bay Mahabaleshwar. Its located in Saj Resort Mahabaleshwar. Highly recommended to all for any kind of celebration. Excellent service given by Manas and Abhijeet. Excellent Live music.
excellent mockta session done by Mr. Manas and Mr subhanksr at barbecue bay restaurant . mojito was excellent . blue legoon was also outstanding. must visit. best barbecue at mahabaleshwar. subhankar was the bartendar and dipali also was nice
"Not worth it. They have tried to replicate Barbeque nation but couldn‚Äôt match the service.
Too expensive.
Perhaps only good side is open air and good weather."
"Food taste was good, although not enough variety of starters.
Live music was good üëç"
One of the best restaurants in mahabaleshwar is Barbecue bay at Saj. Excellent food and services.  Special thanks to  Manas  and rahul  team  for best  hospitality. Highly recommended to all must  visit
"It is costlier as compared to other barbecue restaurant in the metro cities and even the quantity, quality and taste is not at par."
