It does not take very long to wander around the area but you can spend the whole day just enjoying the buzz and watching locals around
Gateway of India is Mumbai s most famous monument . It was a very good experience for me . It was built as a triumphal arch to commemorate the visit of king George V
"this is an iconic monument, but will only take max 5-10 min of your time, including strolling the boat jetty and promenade"
Im not sure what event was on but this place was heaving with people and a zone to enter & leave not open like some of the recent pics! This meant it was very congested in the area and sadly despite modest clothing i was still touched in areas i would have preferred not to be whilst walking behind my husband - more than once & sadly detracts from my memory
"The Most famous monument of Mumbai, brings back the Era of British colonization, well crafted and sheer sign of beautiful artmanship done by Muslims and Hindus art men displays a sense of religious unity. "
"The monument itself is nice. Sadly, it is a reminder of the cruel British invaders who enriched themselves, while murdering and negatively impacting the lives of millions of India’s citizens."
Great to visit this in person.
"Interesting because of the history, but no real way to learn more about it. I would have loved more textual directions"
It was free entry so don't let anyone try and charge you to get through the fences. Plenty of security which is good to see.
You must visit this place if you are a resident of Mumbai or currently residing in Mumbai. It is better to visit it in Day Light because you can see the beautifully carved scriptures and the Beauty of the Gateway of India. 
One of the most iconic locations in Mumbai!
A light and sound show will be inaugurated in Feb 2023.
while this is a landmark of mumbai...there is a need to undertake repairs and better manage people visiting this place every day
"Gets extremely busy. Go early or late to avoid the crowds and heat, can be seen in a short space of time. Some great photo opportunities."
"Apart from the beauty and iconic architecture, there are some other interesting things that add to the overall experience. "
The Gateway of India is an iconic landmark of Mumbai City .
"It overlooks the Arabian Sea ,with Taj Mahal Palace located just next to it ."
"Early morning or late night is a good time to visit ,as it can get really crowded during the day."
It must visit morning or night.It's beautiful historical place In mumbai.when we were there a lot of crowd there.We enjoyed the boat.Beautiful Gateway Of India🇮🇳.
"Excellent place to visit, we loved it overall and highly recommended. Best for couples ND a must visit place in Mumbai not to miss"
Interesting site to understand the power of British rule in India and to see where the last British soldiers said farewell to India
"Both the Gateway and the Taj Mahal Palace hotel (not that of Akra) are iconic buildings, making the area interesting. From there, you can take a boat to Elephanta caves. Worth visiting!"
The Gateway is quite a large archway located in the Colaba region of Mumbai. There is a large area in front of the gate where many people congregate and take photos. The gateway is very large and has some information about the history. 
"A must-visit landmark when in Mumbai. I got to see the sunset, nightfall, sunrise through the Gateway of India while staying at the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower."
"The Gateway of India is a historical monument located in Mumbai, India. It was built in 1911 to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to India."
Very impressive structure in the front of the famous and exclusive Taj Mahal Hotel. There are lot of various boats in the harbor.
Visited with family after a long gap and very good to see
"Nice Architecture with rich history, one of the most valuable for every Indian"
Nothing more specific important to visit here just a normal basic visit just to see the monument security is good and tourists are more
Beautiful architecture and it’s clean and not moldy or mildewy like some buildings/structures can be. All the gates and security around it make it a bit hard to navigate but it’s well worth small inconveniences.
"We came her to watch the sunrise and it was lovely. The main thing to note is that, because of the mist and smog, you won't actually see the sun until 5-10 minutes after the actual sunrise time, until it gets higher in the sky."
"Built in the early years of 20th century to welcome the British ruling monarch coming to India via sea, this the perfect structure standing tall to tell what one should expect when they land in Mumbai coming via sea route."
It’s always crowded even in early morning however it’s highly secured. Officers are visible in the area at all times. The place is clean and well maintained. I love the flock of birds being fed early morning. It’s located adjacent to the Taj Mahal Palace.
Good place to visit. Bit crowded. Noting much to do except monument or boat ride (local or to Eliphanta caves). Mostly you will find it as a crowded place with difficult parking.
"Very nice tour ; wonderful views of Gateway of India from the boat. We did the tour early morning , 25th of december, so the island was not too crowded. We made the tour with a guide of Magic Mumbai that gives a lot of info to my teens"
"Was a wonderful experience visiting the gateway of India, its an icon of tourism in Mumbai, learnt a lot about it, its indeed a wonderful place to learn about Colonial era"
"The gateway itself is stunning but slightly overcrowded with tourists which erode the overall experience. It is also outshined by the nearby Taj Mahal Hotel. That being said, it is a quintessential photo stop no first-time visitor should ever leave Mumbai without."
"Including this is a must as it is an historic landmark and a great structure to photograph. Up close or seen from a ferry boat en route to Elephanta caves - or if you are fortunate like me, to have a window table for high tea at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel - Sea lounge."
"Honestly, we walked around the gata must visit for every citizen of bombay. just chill, enjoy the cool breeze, take pictures and enjoy a boat rideeway, and I wasn't fascinated, or excited by it. If you're in a rush you can skip this location."
"a must visit for every citizen of bombay. just chill, enjoy the cool breeze, take pictures and enjoy a boat ride"
"We stayed across the street from the Gateway, and it is a beautiful, historic landmark. Tourists and locals flock to see the grandeur and symbolic gateway to the country. "
Had a day to kill as friends flew by from Hyderabad as this was a short visit to Mumbai. Had an Innova for 8 hours started off from Khar with the first stop at Gateway of India to reminisce my trip a decade ago.
