"Due to cloud covering we couldn't able to see sunrise. So I am not excited there but the nature is awesome. I expected more so I am disappointed. If you want to visit there don't expect anything simply see it without assumptions then it will be satisfied. Space is not enough to occupy more people however crowd is not there. Early morning nature is amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è
Road is available so Vehicles can go up there."
The sunrise view from this point was awesome and memorable. U will get good position to sit and watch this view if u reach little early. The experience you going to get by seeing the sun coming out slowly is mesmerising
"Great place for the sunrise
U can see a great view
U can go for a morning or evening walk there.
As I can see some of the people's are doing jogging there.
Not so far from Mahabaleshwar temple.
Be careful while driving as road are not so good during rainy season's."
"Wilson Point is the highest point in Mahabaleshwar, in terms of Altitude.
It is a flat ground type,. locally called as Table Land. The view of Krishna river is excellent from here. The perimeter is around 5 kms. One can reach here by car & take Horse riding or can roam around by foot.
There are many vacant places around here where one can enjoy the view of nature. One can also wander into the lonely places and enjoy the sound of birds."
"A bit difficult to reach if you are following google, but there is a better road which locals might suggest you. This is a nice place, with beautiful scenery. Being the highest point in Mahabaleshwar, this place is spread over a huge area unlike other points. Enjoyed it, must visit if you are looking for a less crowded spot in Mahabaleshwar."
"Wilson point also known as the sunrise point in Mahabaleshwar

Woke up at 5o clock to witness the beautiful sunrise at Wilson point the roads were pretty dark but the view is worthy advisable to check the route in a day light before you decide to visit the place for sunrise"
"Wilson Point is the highest point in Mahabaleshwar at 1439 m. Wilson Point is also popularly known as Sunrise Point.

The vast and scenic plateau has three masonry platforms built for your convenience and is the only place that offers stunning views of both sunrise and sunset. With the advantage of height, it also offers surreal views of the Mahabaleshwar city below, transporting you to a world of peace and calm

"Its the bath of sunset. Recommended any time of fhe year as this place creates its own beautyscape with passing of the year's season. One and treak all the way up if not take an automotive till the destination. Horses are also available for riding.

"The ride is good and pleasent to get to , some patches of the road are bad . Peas drive safely because the roads are narrow and many blind spots on the way . You can reach there by bike or by car . The place is big  so take your time to get some beautiful pics from all 4 location . Ease carry some water and a piar of glares . Enjoy and have fun . Horse ride is also available at the location , do bargain with the price ."
"This is a great point to see the sunrise. Ideal time to reach here would be 10-15 minutes before sunrise. We were a bit late, still could get beautiful view of the place. The road is very narrow to reach there. Sun-gazing experience from this point was mesmerising with awesome view and cool breeze around."
"I just can't say enough about this place.. üòç
We have such beautiful places to visit in India.. Why to go anywhere else...?
I have visited this place during off season... In monsoon... So it was really cloudy there...
As I really love to visit places with less crowd... I LOVED IT... ‚ò∫üíöüíö"
Nice place to visit for watching sunrise. Try to reach around 10-15 mins before the sunrise. This place is quite windy so carry proper clothing to protect yourself from cold winds during winter.
I reached here at 5:30 AM and it felt like I am in Manali.. I was shivering and able to take pictures properly.. And what to say about mother Nature beauty.. Awesome.. I wish if I could stay there forever..
Very nice place. Temp was around 16 degree. It was sunset time. The climate was very nice and enjoyable. Must go once.
Best view of sunrise. There are 2 viewing stations. Better reach early to reserve place on the deck. Sometimes you get hot tea also.
Good place for couples. Highest point where entire valley is viewed. Perfect place for photography. Sunrise point.
"Amazing view and climate especially in monsoons
Famous fr sunrise and sunset"
The sunrise view from this point was awesome. We reached a little early and got to a good place. It was so mesmerising.
"Offbeat place. Not a very famous point. But in monsoons and winters, definitely worth visiting."
"Average.
There are other better sunset points in mahabaleshwar than Wilson point."
Decent peaceful place. No crowd. Full of greenery view.
Traveling there is a bit complicated as roads are narrow and ghat
It's a Sunrise Point on a hill platue.
Wilson point is only good to go during rainy season as it is plateau. Horse riding is the only fun activity you can do.
"Views are great
The access road to this point is in bad condition, can be tricky for cars"
Perfect place for watching sunrise üåÑüåÑ
"This place is good for sunrise however I feel a little overrated one if you are already used to seeing sunrise. But still try to reach early as it gets crowded, you can take vehicle till the last point.

Sit, meditate, do yoga and enjoy the forest view"
Nothing much here the scenery is good
Beautiful place for watching sunset! Can spend hours just sitting here and watching the beautiful view! The road to this point is bad though..
"If you come to Mahabaleshwar then definately go to this point very ideal location to enjoy and have some snaps.
I recommend timings to visit this point are 6:00 to 8:30 in Morning and in Evening 5:00 to 6:30 is the best time you can have on this point.I recommend to go on this point by walking from Mahabaleshwar main market its roughly about 2 KM."
Looking for sunrise point is Mahabaleshwar? Your search is over. This is the the best for the full and beautiful sunrise of Mahabaleshwar. You can directly take your bike /car to this point and captured the sunrise directly from your car. Best time to reach around 6 am to capture all the shades of sky.
Serene experience and wonderful view. Spend a few minutes in solitude and regain your energies.
One of the best place beautiful sunrise beautiful nature this  where you can get peace of mind
Too good... we went during the rainy time and it was sublime. Open space with less crowd... not sure how it is on a regular day...
"there's nothing special about this place...you just get to see beautiful scenary....horse riding and a long, calm walk is all that this place can offer"
Nice place..but we couldn't see sunrise due to visibility not good.... We visited during Diwali '21 holidays
Nice place to trek to. Not much to do there but to enjoy its unique terrain & some hill view.
Normal point and not that much crowded but nice view
Amazing place during monsoon seasons.....
Very quiet and peaceful place
Super view and must visit place for nature lover. Here you can spend hours and enjoy nature. This place is for sunrise though we visited in after noon and we loved it. Peaceful place in noon.
A beautiful place to visit in Mahabaleshwar. You should plan for morning at 5.30 am and come here. Because later on there is too much crowd so can not enjoy Sunrise. Very beautiful view. You will be remember Life time. Don't miss. Always have it in plan. And do visit.
Only sunset point is worth !
"Table too like point with 3-4 sections for see site points. With 2-3 hire riding options

Only point to take care when reaching the point is that it‚Äôs very steep slope and when arriving by vehicle need to take care while going up."
One of the best place in mahabaleshwar to enjoy wonderful sunrise
Little difficult to reach via car otherwise beautiful place.

"Best Place to visit at night for star gazing! so orion belt , Musk's satellite and mars."
Really beautiful with cold and pleasant wind.
Nice location to enjoy beautiful Sunrise and Sunset.
At the peak you will find a complete open space and you can experience a beautiful Sunrise and sunset.. Reach before 5.30 am/pm to experience it.
Very difficult to see sunrise.
"Best place to watch sunrise. No shop's at road,  so clean and open place.  Temperature is quite low at this point.  You need personal car to visit this point."
"You will not get the view of valley here. What you get is  beautiful sunrise view. Roads leading to Wilson point are quite narrow and few patches are very bad. Drive safely and with patience as there are many blind spot.
Horse riding can be enjoyed here. Ample of parking so it will not be an issue. Apart from this you will find nothing over there. So if you are with kids you can avoid this place for sure."
Enjoy sunrise and good walk.Also visit Wilson House.

"One of the highest sunrise point of mahableshwar....
"
A serene place on the mountain top to enjoy a chilly sunset.
Awesome place but not a real sunset point as advertised. Scenic though. You will love the moonrise more here. Secluded. The road is a bit risky as its a only one vehicle road.
Best place to visit in monsoon
"Best hill lake view point of mahabaleshwar, good vibes"
"This place is highest place in mahabaleshwar.  Very good view of city. And surrounding.
"
Nice place to view sunrise in morning and sunset in evening. Also one gets complete view of Mahabaleshwar city. One can enjoy cool breeze and have morning or evening walk.
"Great view not too many tourists,serene"
The highest point of Mahabaleshwar. You will found the climate over here always chilled and cool even during May Summer season. Must visit.
This is the highest point in Mahabaleshwar. It's a sunrise point. It's on a plateau that one reaches after climbing a steep slope. Good place for a morning walk if you are staying closer to the main market/ Aram chowk.
One of the many points of Mahabaleshwar. Not that great view from the end
Good point to observe beautiful sunrise of Mahabaleshwar. It is the highest point of Mahabaleshwar.
Best ever view during sunset time..
