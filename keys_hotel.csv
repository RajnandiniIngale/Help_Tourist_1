"The place is amazing as far as the location goes. They have various activities inside the resort which keeps everyone engaged and entertained. The pool is great and the ambience is amazing. Only thing disappointed this time was the food particularly buffet, their was variety but not taste, breakfast buffet was still good compare to dinner buffet. Room service food tasted amazing but a bit overpriced.",4,5,5
