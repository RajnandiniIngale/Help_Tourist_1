Worli koliwada is one of the seven orginal isands of Mumbai. It a home to the koli community. Must visit place for travel bloggers.
This is a small fort at the sea shore - famous for movie shootings - it definitely needs some maintenance and uplifting and taking care of garbage management.

This fort was built in 17th century. And it is very beautiful with beautiful vibes. The place is very refreshing and cleanliness is OK OK. But it is one of the most beautiful place I have seen. Must visit.

After the Mahim fort fell to the Portuguese in 1517 they built this fort Castella de Aguada in 1640. There was source for drinking water nearby which was used to supply water to the fort. 
This place which looks like a fort is now more of a place for cheap love birds. Not recommended for family at all.

Great place to visit during monsoon and to click a picture. You have Arabian sea and Worli sealink on one side and Taj Land end on the other side.

"Castella de Aguada, also known as the Bandra Fort, is a fort located near Bandstand in Bandra, Mumbai. It seems its Portuguese builders actually called it Forte de Bandorá. "
The place is located very near to taj lands end. Many locals come there to spend some time as it has a very good view of the bandra worli sea link.
The view from here is great but the place is usually dirty and filled with people. Not as good as it used to be.
"Lots of locals come to this vista point. A very good view of the bridge, Bandra-Worli Sea Link."

Bandra fort is very old one but its not well maintained. there is lot of construction around and its not an ideal place for picnic
The Bandra Fort is located in the south part of Bandra. It's usually very packed with people. From tourists to students relaxing. 
Do not visit with family as its place for couples only annoying. You can have a nice view of Worli sea link from the fort.
This is a great place to visit especially around sunset time for photography of the bandra worli sealink and the sunset as well. There's a garden here as well but be advised you'll find a lot of couples in cozy cuddly and even questionable positions too.

The view from this fort is to die for. With the ocean touching your feet and on the other hand the huge worli sea link in view. 
"Bandra Fort is located at the tip of Bandra West, where is meets the sea! The views from the fort are simply mind blowing! The view of the city and of the sea link are just spectacular. "
Though its a small area where the fort is built but it gives a good view of the worli sea link and the sea as well. Must visit during good weather so that one can spend some quality time at the place.
