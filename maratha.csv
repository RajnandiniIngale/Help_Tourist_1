"Nice place to stay in the city. Basic rooms. Breakfast has very limited options. The staff was also did not appear to be trained for politeness to guest queries. They were brusque when responding to our requests. The Location of the hotel is in the midst of city making it comfortable to move around."
"Great hotel with awesome food and a good conference/ banquet room where around 100 people can be seated. It is a great place for small events and the food is particularly very good. There is a seperate place for food where buffet lunch/dinner can be served. The washrooms are best and clean and a sufficient parking space is also available."
"Staff was very polite and the room tarriff was quite reasonable. They certainly deserve a pat on their back . Thanks maratha regency for your wonderful service and food."
"Stayed overnight and had good experience, friendly staff, the hotel is near Mahalakshmi Devasthanam and main market, food was really good, room service was little slow, child friendly, clean place"
"Rooms were clean but not up to the expectations based on what they charge. Food is freaking expensive. It mentions itself as a 3 star hotel however it is a 2 star. Earlier back in 2016, it was lavish but over time the luxury experience diminished."

"No cleanliness in the room. Pathetic service by house keeping. The hotel gives one sachet of Wagh Bakrid instant tea and HALF LITRE WATER! only as complimentary per day and pushes us to place order at Restaurant if we need more water or instant tea/coffee... please don't waste your hard earned money with these kind of hotels..."

"Each & every one working at Hotel Maratha Regency was so helpful & co-operative specially Mr Prabhu Sir who personally looked into what were our requirements and helped us get wonderful rooms with all the good amenities at the hotel.
Comp. Breakfast was so good really enjoyed Batata Vada Idli Sambar Medu vada , Masala Egg Omelette. The rooms were so beautiful with large french windows to enjoy the view outside.
The travel desk staff helped us book travel destination, sight seeing spots which was so beautiful, divine and eye catching Shree Mahalakshmi Ambabai Devi Mandir and other beautiful places. During our sight seeing, we enjoyed delicious traditional maharashtrian food - pitla- bhakri & bharlerli vangi. Not to forget the most delectable Tambda rassa and Pandhra rassa for non vegetarians, chicken and mutton dishes.
I thank all the staff who helped us in making our Kolhapur trip so enjoyable.
The restaurant at Hotel Maratha Regency named Masala Pot served such scrumptious food. We even threw a surprise birthday party for my maushi, which the hotel staff agreed instantly and helped us to keep it a sweet surprise.
Overall experience at the hotel was so enchanting and delightful.
It was good that we were not addicted to our mobile phones as wifi connectivity was not strong enough, so we enjoyed a good time with family singing Antakshari and playing damcharades in our rooms which was really needed to relax during our short stay at Hotel Maratha Regency.
To each and everyone including Mr Prabhu Sir, we once again thank you for giving us such a wonderful experience during our stay. We would again like to come back soon to this Hotel Maratha Regency to destress. Best wishes from Sandip Kumta & Vidya Kumta & Nagarkatti family."
"Worst rooms, Bed And Blanket looks like local road side lodge. Curtains not even of proper size.Charging rate of 3 Star hotel but not providing even a Hot water cattle and Tea pouch in rooms.
Never try to stay"
"Neat and clean rooms. The staff is humble and polite. Breakfast quality was great."
"I stayed here for 5 days. I was not impressed at the service quality. My dad lost a pajama when the room was cleaned. There was not much effort on the part of the hotel management to locate it. On one occasion, I asked for some cutlery to be delivered to our room. It took 30 minutes and 3 phone calls to get it. A couple of electrical switches were broken. I am not sure it qualifies for a 3 star hotel rating."
"Went for dinner at their restaurant. Good food. Nice ambience. Staff is friendly."
"Excellent experience...neat n clean rooms...value for money hotel..."
"Rooms are clean...but a bit expensive according to the service which were given..."

"The reason behind 3 stars is because there was some wierd smell in the lobby and restaurant, which was too much for me!! The service was excellent, we stayed only 1 night!! The mattresses are bit on the harder side... Rest it was good"
