"One of the most famous and widely visited tourist attraction in Mahabaleshwar, specially know for the boat rides and the roadside snacks near to it, also one can take horse rides next to the lake. It's a must visit place in Mahabaleshwar,  this is man made lake, it's recommended to visit this place in the Evening during sunset, as the sunset from this point is very beautiful and one shall enjoy the boat ride with a scenic view."

"Venna lake has good food stalls & parking area near it. There is boating facility out there. The cost is really high of approx 1200 for half hour & 600 for 15 mins. But the boating experience is quite good.

"Venna Lake is a great tourist attraction spot in Mahabaleshwar. This lake was constructed by Shri Appasaheb Maharaj, who was Raja (King) of Satara in 1842. The length of the lake is 4 km and width is 1.5 kms. The lake is surrounded by green trees. In late evening one can see the clouds passing over lake water. There is a horse ride just next to the lake. Also, lot of food joints on the road. Few local vendors sell carrots and strawberry near the road. I will highly recommend to buy carrots as they are organic and tastes great. Venna Lake is approx 2 kms away from ST stand/ city market. There are few attractions for kids like toy train, toy cups, giant wheel etc.
The rates for boating are 500+200 for 30 mins assisted ride. 200 for the boating person.

Be careful while using google map as it can direct to other side of lake where you will not be able to reach main lake entrance."
"Refreshing üå∏& beautiful lake in Mahabaleshwar .
One of the major tourist attraction & to do boating üõ∂ lake .
We went in afternoon time .
There is always long queue for tickets üé´.
But once you sit in boat you will forget everything.
Cooling & soothing breeze will freshen you üÜô.

Colourful & yummy fruits üçíüçì üçâ üçéavailable outside lake is must haves."
"Veena lake is situated far from mahableshwar other famous point so any tourist package will charge 200-300 extra to include Veena lake in the package. You have booking option there which charges around 400 per row boat and 600 per padel boat for 30 minutes. If you are taking boat for ourselves you have to give 1000 deposit so in case you come delayed your extra charge will be deducted from the deposit. If you pay 200 extra you won't have to pay deposit and there will be a person to take you in the boat and you don't have to row it. We can call it a trap but had no other option to take this option of paying 200 extra to avoid deposit losses and also was so tired that we can't row it else won't be able to enjoy also not so expert in rowing it. I would recommend to pay 200 extra better if you want to enjoy the trip. If you are 4 people it's hardly 50 rupees each which is worth.
"
"Loved that it was super clean. Eco sensitive area.
Can take self peddler boats or boat with a rower.
Would suggest self paddling boats for 2-3 people.
You get the boat for 60 mins.
Rates vary from 600-900‚Çπ.
"
"A nice lake formed by River Venna. Crowded in the evenings as tourists flock it for boat rides and to have food at nearby small shops (surprisingly mostly owned by Muslims). You can hire a boat for 600-800 Rupees for 1 hour. One family occupies one boat. Google map to this place doesn't show correct location so be careful while reaching here as you may have to return after going ahead some 5-6 km.
"
"A good place, peaceful, calm, happening tourist spot. It was Saturday, huge crowd sas there. In the March as well, climate was cool, joyful.. We did paddle boating, 1 hr timing.. Rste was reasonable.."

The boating facilities available here are a great way to enjoy the calm waters and take in the natural beauty. The park surrounding the lake is a perfect spot for a picnic or a relaxing walk.

There are many food stalls were you can try corn frankie and pattice, the local speciality and Strawberry with cream as a dessert."
Nice Clean Lake. Too much rush for getting boat ticket. Parking is another challange near venna lake.
"This is one of the best views, I've ever experienced. This is one of the most amazing places to visit, in Mahabaleshwar. You'll have nearly no wait to go in. You can click pictures, have some snacks, and spend some good time, with Nature.  Overall, it's Great.

"Horses catch the attraction of whole place. Mashallah so many horses and with dissimilar cute names loved it ! Near Lake there are some food stalls (foodstuff) to try it's yummy üòã ‚Ä¶
"
"If u are on weekends...go for boating lil early...closes arrd 6
00 6 30. Always a queue. Paddle boat is generally available easily but rowing doesn't as it comes with person who rows the boat for u. 400 Rs for half an hour for rowing boat. Board doesnt mentions how much you pay to the person who will be with you as rower but i guess they loot public depending upon the rush at the venue. Lake is very old and main source of water for mahabaleshwar.  Freezes in winter."
"Prices are really high, SOMETHING IF REALLY FISHY IN TERMS OF THEY ARE CHARGING EXTRA MONEY AND ALSO DON'T PROVIDE ANY BILLS ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

AS A CUSTOMER THE BOATING EXPERIENCE AND HORSE RIDING IS GOOD BUT AS A CONSUMER, THEY ARE DOING REALLY BIG MESS SOMEWHERE IN THE CORNER
"
"Boating here is quite nice! The view is really satisfying. You'll feel calm & refreshed after the boating. Also, there are some food stalls outside the Venna Lake Boating. And, there is horse riding too.

"Venna Lake in Mahabaleshwar is a picturesque spot that is known for its beauty and serenity. Located in the Satara district of Maharashtra, this lake is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the area. Venna Lake is surrounded by lush green hills and is the perfect spot for a peaceful stroll or a leisurely boat ride."
"Pros -
1) Clean and deep lake - scenic beauty

Cons-
1) Massive mismanagement. Pandemic or otherwise, there is always hundreds of folks in the evening, particularly during the weekend.
2) The boat ride is for 1000 for an hour which you are yourself supposed to row.
3) There was no sanitation around.
4) The parking is a mess - visitors need to undertake a long walk

Wish authorities take note to make the place a better place!"
"Venna Lake is a scenic manmade lake in Mahabaleshwar. The lake offers rowboats, and paddleboats ride to the visitors and hence is usually very crowded. There is horse riding and rides for children such as merry go round and the toy train. There are a number of eateries around the lake famous for street food like corn, bhelpuri and fresh fruits like mulberries, strawberries and carrots.

Venna Lake was built by Shri Appasaheb Maharaj who was the ruler of Satara and a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, in 1942. The lake is spread over an area of 28 acres with a periphery of 7 to 8 km. It was initially built with the aim of catering to the water needs of the city of Mahabaleshwar"
"Nice place for boating but be careful selecting rides. for rowing boat as they have not mention charges correctly.The rate displayed are for self drive and if you choose for driver they charge extra on the basis of hours.For half hour Rs100 and for 1 hour Rs200.So be careful many times they ask for more money at the end so discuss every thing before taking ride.
"
Beautiful lake which was heart of Mahabaleshwar city.what a climate and green nature here.
"Nice place , you can enjoy here boat , horse riding"
Enjoy the hot maggie and kullat chai with the cold foggy view of beautiful lake veena... Horse riding and boating is available...
"One of the lakes available in Mahabaleshwar. It's at the peak in the month of September and October during the rainy season.

Boating at the location is a must and recommend as well. During the weekdays the cost is optimal and can be negotiated. During the weekend there is a long waiting for the boating at the location.

The boating cost is per boat wise. Hence it you are a couple it's recommended to patch up with another couple so that the cost is split among for boating. Per boat cost is 800 for a longest ride till the Hanuman Temple."
"My family was excited and happy with the boat club ride..they enjoyed it a lot.  Vienna lake is especially known for the boat rides and the roadside snacks near it, also one can take horse rides next to the lake. It's a must-visit place in Mahabaleshwar,  and it's recommended to visit this place in the Evening during sunset."
Best experience view is so amazing do visit 
"This place is amazing you can do boating üö£ üö£‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è , riding üê¥ üêé , eating üç± and lots of fun.
They gave boats üõ∂ on rents.
They have two types of boats pedal boat and  ""chapu"" boat üõ∂."
"Venna lake is one of the major tourist attractions in Mahabaleshwar. It is a beautiful place where one can enjoy boat ride and next to the lake horse ride. Near lake there are a lot of food joints where different varieties of mouthwatering snacks are available. I visited the lake in monsoon so the lake is all covered with fog. But next day the weather was clear so I could enjoyed the view. This is the place you can enjoy with your family and friends. But one thing that is missing is cleanliness of the lake side area.
"
"Boating - both options are good.
Horse ride - depends on negotiation, a 100 rs round is worth, horses are trained to go alone, U can enjoy riding it alone.
Parking - available with a fees of 50rs.
Food n eatery - good variety.
Ice gola - worth a try, It's 50rs."
First of all don‚Äôt follow this Wala map it‚Äôs not correct route. Follow ‚Äòvenna lake boating‚Äô this is correct map location. Beautiful place for outing with family and friends. horse riding and boating available but too much costly. So many types of food available. Due to horse riding this place is too dusty
Place is beautiful but the cost of boating is same for 2 persons and for 5 person also 800 not affordable for individual n couple ..for group the boating is worthy
"One of the lake with clean water and people of surrounding villages use this water for drinking. Visit, enjoy rowing the boat, but keep the lake clean."
pleasant boating experience in the evenings
"Beautiful lake with facilities for boating, horse riding etc and lots of options for eating. All sorts of street food and drinks available.
Looks crowded and sort of commercialized and crammed place rather than real natural beauty like Tapola lake.
Weekends evenings, school holiday seasons and festivals get really jam packed due to visitors from Mumbai and Pune looking for a break from routing life."
"Beautiful, peaceful, place. Children love this place because of the boat ridings and horse ridings, not so clean, but ok. Boating is cool, you can sail by peddle boats or by boats with assistants. A lot of food stalls are there  And there is one more like amusement park near by the Venna lake. Famous spot to hang out."
"Beautiful lake view  and you can do horse riding and boating here and on street food you can buy corn ,fruit and other food shops are there."
It is very peaceful to sit here in the evening. There is also parking near this lake. Can also ride a horse. There are also food shops here. Amazing place. Sunset is also visible from here. It is a good place to enjoy boating.
"Its a great experience boating in the Venna lake, the view is awesome, I visited there nearly at 5 pm, it was the sunset time and weather was great.. The sunset view was so beautiful. Its a tourist attraction spot in Mahabaleshwar and you shouldn't miss it. The only thing is there's a huge line and you have to struggle to get your chance."
"Very nice place to visit during Mahabaleshwar trip. One cannot miss to do boating in Venna lake. Water is clean. You have options to hire rowing boat or paddle boat. For rowing boat, boatman are available who row the boat for us on chargeable basis.
"
"The only lake in Mahabaleshwar ... Nice place for boating... The banks of the lake have all the touristy stuff..Merrygo-rounds, horse riding, food stalls, game stalls etc... You will find it extremely crowded  especially during the holidays. Parking is limited given the rush of folks to this place.
It is right after the toll booth before entering Mahabaleshwar town."
"Enjoyed the paddle boating. Awesome experience of self boating with friends.
Also have a spot of hoarse riding , but that is costly and not worth for the charges they make.
Jai shree Ram üö© ‚Ä¶"
"Nice place to visit, awesome to boat during sunset"
"Beautiful place to visit. View of the lake is simply awesome. We haven‚Äôt did boating here because of the closing time but we did horse riding.
Horse riding is little bit costly as it charges 200 rs for a round, and the round ends in a single minute.
Would like to do boating next time for sure. Overall it‚Äôs a nice place if you are visiting with your loved ones/family/friends."
"Venna lake is the major tourist attraction in Mahabaleshwar. You can enjoy a boat ride over the lake or horse ride next to the lake.
Such beautiful lake is surrounded by the trees.
"
"Venna lake is the one of the most popular and visited tourist spot in Mahabaleshwar which is located at a distance of around 2km from bus stand. This is famous lake located in Mahabaleshwar for boating activities. One can choose among rowboats and pedal boats. This lake was constructed by Shri Appasaheb Maharaj  in 1842, who was the King of Satara. It was aimed to create a water reservoir for the Mahabaleshwar city. The lake is spread on a huge area of around 28 acres and its periphery is spread over 7 to 8 km.

Things to do at Venna Lake:
1. As it is spread in vast area, Boating at Venna lake is mesmerized memory and most of the people specially couple comes here for boat riding.
2. Traveler's keep  coming back here as classic Horse Riding offered here along with the beautiful views of gardens and mountains
3. Due to its beautiful surrounding gardens, tourists who have interest in photography feel attracted towards this location.
4. A beautiful Garden is formed surrounding the lake which still offers an eye soothing experience.
5. Lake surrounding area is fully crowded with Eatable stalls. All type of street food is available here. One can enjoy the same with loved ones.

Small Tip:
As this is most happening area of Mahabaleshwar getting parking for your four wheeler is task here. So better park your vehicle at proper location and then walk towards Venna Lake to enjoy Boating, Walking in Garden and Eating street food"
"Venna Lake is a good spot in Mahabaleshwar. I will start with the following topics:
1. You have to pay for parking anywhere or everywhere you park your car
2. Visiting Venna lake in the afternoon time is less crowded. If you plan to go post 4-5 pm you have to stand in a queue which is a total waste of time.
3. Cost of the boats is very expensive in season. Don't get dragged by the local people there always play smart or they will loot you easily.
4 You can have a short horse ride there too if you have a short duration in Mahabaleshwar. Or you can go to table land which is better for a long ride.
5. You will find fast food only near Venna Lake. Make sure you have all the arrangements with you. Or just 1KM or 2KM from the location you will find a good restaurant.
6. Make sure you pay using cash for the car park. If you pay using a fast tag there are additional charges.
7. Make sure to check the strawberry price everywhere if you want to save money."
The venna boating location is the correct place fot this.. google map usually is showing wrong location. Good place with lot of hawkers and vegetables vendors. was less crowded when i visited in march. May see uptick in visits during rush days.
"It's Good. For boating. It costs 600 for 6 people for pedal boat and for diesel boat it costs 800 for 1 hour.
Recommend time:- 5 Pm to 6 Pm"
"This is good point to visit in Mahabaleshwar.

We reached first at the top to Mahadev Temple and slowly we came down to visit all the points. On the midway before wax museum we have venna lake boating point.

They take 300 for 6 people boating for half an hour and
600 for 6 people for 1 hour.

Happy boating üòä"
"Amazing Place !
I would love visit this place here again with blink of an eye! This place is so Serene that you can feel the calmness.  this is the perfect place for sunset. the boating experience was exotic and I must tell you an interesting thing-  the lake that you see is so clean that it is used for drinking. I loved the experience here. You have good parking space Available for a car. There are few horse riders that would tell you to board a horse for a nice ride. The boat ride charges are 600 for half an hour and 800 for an hour. They take 1000 for two people as a token amount and accordingly the amount would be returned."
"Must visit attractions in Mahabaleshwar, local body maintains the boat ride here. Morning boating experience is the best to have."
"This lake is Overhyped, Overcrowded and Overpriced all the time. Walk, Enjoy the surrounding and eateries."
"Pleasant place, nice to visit with family also. Main attraction point in Mahabaleshwar. 40 plus boats are available so waiting is negligible. You can also ride boat by self with 1000rs deposit"
It was a place with full of dust because of people doing horse ride. The boating experience is excellent. The place is lack of basic facilities and not at all clean otherwise it would have been a great place to visit. The local administration should spend some money and energy to do some upliftment.
Nice place for boating and enjoying nature. There are lot of stalls for food and many have options for Jain food as well. Best time to visit in evenings. There is also space for horse riding. The queue for boating is big but worth waiting.
"Excellent place, take the boat service from the counter, do not fall for the jacks there, they over charge and cheat on the time duration of the ride. The boat club should do something to stop these jacks from looting people."
It is a nice and lovely place. Views are mesmerizing. Horse riding is available and most of all you can run the horse.  There is also a boating club here with paddle boats and boats. You can drive the boats if you like or if you want you can ride in one . A lot of street food is available there and parking is free.
"This is a beautiful lake where on one end there is Garden, series of vendors selling eatables and a place to hire boats. There are both varietes of boats - self driven and with a driver. There is too much rush for the boat during holiday season. One can just sit on the shore and enjoy the beauty."
Good place for boating and amazing view. Charges for manual(paddle) boat 5 persons are 440+ deposit of 60 INR and time limit is 1 hour. For boating with a guide or trained pilot is 350 approx for 5 people and you don't get a chance to drive and enjoy.
"Do visit this lake if you are visiting mahabaleshwar or panchgani. Boating is available here. Just near it, there's a open ground where you can enjoy horse riding. This place has a great crowd in the evening so plan accordingly. If you go on boating the nature surrounding the lake looks really beautiful. Overall a great place.
"
"Enjoy your day in this lazy lake with a view...
Ps check the prices for half n hour and one hour.
They also have horse riding near by."
"Nice and crowded place for hangout
One of the best place in mahabaleshwar for chill out with loved ones.
Even we can see sunset from the lake while riding the boat.
Love this place"
Beautiful lake near mahabaleshwar to visit with friends & family to spend your quality time. Boating and horse riding is available there. They charge 100 rs person for horse riding. Must visit at evening time. And many different chatpati food are available here.
It was nice experience to enjoy boating on venna lake . You will get various types of boat but you have to provide deposit before taking tickets. Nice surrounding and nature....
"View of lake os very amazing , you can do  boating here and there is horse riding beside this.
"
"The place is okay if you just want to roam and relax. Parking is a problem during weekends and all of the horse riding happens in the parking area. The tickets to the boat is unorganised, however the person rowing our boat was friendly. The small park next to the lake is good as it reminded me of the good old fun and fair days. A lot of snacks joint next to the lake. Surprisingly, it was clean everywhere."
"Nice place, but very expensive rides
"
"Excellent spot in scenic Mahabaleshwar. nice place to enjoy with family & friends. Boating, horse riding, many stalls to enjoy snacks, ice cream & milk shakes. Small amusement for children."
"This is a must visit place when you are going mahabaleshawar. The water is neat and clean. It offers boating on rent. The boating starts from 10 in the morning to till sunset. Parking space is there. In front of the lake some shops are there which offers food, shakes and fun games. Strawberry shake is worth trying. Horse riding is also available there which will be fun for kids."
"This lake is really serene and peaceful in its own context. But one would find queue for boating tickets during peak season. The rates are 300per row boat for 30mins for 6 people max and you need to spend something additional for the person rowing the boat. Here you can get two variety boats (row boat & self paddle boat). The real experience starts when you go to the inside of the lake and the beauty absolutely appeals. A should to visit even for a second timer. And not to worry the lake hosts just fresh water fish. So enjoy.
"
"Its a nice place and attracts quite a lot tourists. People can enjoy boating and horse riding , it‚Äôs beautiful and scenic and is a popular location with picturesque view"
"My dream Location. Love this place.
My favourite place to visit while I am in Mahabaleshwar. Parking is an issue there. Lots of games and food available at that spot. You can also enjoy horse riding at the same spot.
There is a temple there as well that can only be accesses if you take a boat ride.
"
One of the best place to enjoy in Mahabaleshwar. Best time to visit is winter. Lake is clean. Boating is allowed on fare. There are paddle type boats as well as rowing boats. Fares are charged on hourly base. Horse ridings are available near lake.
"Lovely clean place with boatsmen who have been around for ages. It's worth paying the extra 100 and taking a driver/boatman along. The ride around the lake is 20 minutes at the most.
"
A beautiful surroundings and boating facility is available. Plenty space for car parking. They charge around 500 for one hour boating.
Popular place of Mahabaleshwar.
"Lake with beautiful viewsüòç. You can do boating here with very cheap rates. If you cant boat, you can hire a guy for Rs.200 and he will do it for you. The place is lil crowdy. You can do horse riding near this place. ‚Ä¶
"
"We went here on a weekend, there was a rush and slot of people veven though it is during the pandemic. Ensure you have your masks on and carry your sanitizer.

Affordable prices for boating, both peddle boat and row boating options available. If you have a group of 4 then go for the peddle boat option as it is cheaper and you can swap the positions midway. Rowing boat is recommended for families as they have a person who does the rowing for you, while you enjoy the warm sun and cool breeze. It takes about 30minutes to reach to the other side of the lake, so plan your time accordingly."
"Were on a family trip to Mahabaleshwar
We stopped while returning back to Pune. The period when we were here was really nice as it was raining heavily hence surrounded by nice fog and chilled weather. We did a horse riding ( bit expensive, 200 bucks for 8-10 minutes ride). But overall a must drive in monsoon.The riding in Venna lake is closed as lake is full of water."
People who like boating can stop here. Rowing boat and paddle boats are available. You get a person to row the boat or you can choose paddle if you want to paddle yourself. I think maximum 7 person can be accomodated in one boat. You pay for the boat and not per person charge. Its around 400‚Çπ for one boat for a half hour with maximum of 7 persons.There are food stalls near by to pound on munchies.
"Nice lake for boating. Two boating options available- rowing boat and paddle boat. I have picture here describing prices and capacity of boats (in Marathi). On the right side of lake is Horse Riding option costing Rs.100 for very short ride of around a minute. You can also buy strawberries here for Rs.200/kg and fast food is also available.
Lake is also very beautiful."
Visiting Venna lake in Mahabaleswar during rains is once in a life time experience. If you want to be amongst the cloud or wants to feel cloud touching your body visit Venna lake during monsoon season between June to September. Avoid heavy rainfall days as driving becomes extremely difficult. Having makkai in it's various form is very satisfying experience. Wollen cloths are mandatory in rainyseason. Your vehicle should be in perfect condition with fully functioning Head and tail light.
"Excellent get away from the shoe in the city :)
Went on a weekday hence the crowd was not much and had ample time to spend for boating ..
A must go...serene feeling..
There are horse rides too available on the shores..
400 for half an hour for rowing boat
"
Average place. Better if you visit in the evening. Boating and horse riding is available.
"Nice place to boating in evening.
Best place to take natural photos while boating.
Try to avoid visit in lunch time as you will get dehydrated during lunch time.
Also beside lake there is one big hours riding place, you can see some pictures of hours riding ground."
"Boating and horse riding are main attraction.. you will also get fresh strawberries and sweet corns Must visit place in mahabeshwar. It's near to main market. I like this place. My favourite place
a month ago
It's a big lake, one can enjoy a boat ride with their families. One can take a driver for boat or ride itself also."
Venna Lake is the most beautiful and happy place to stay. Here you can enjoy a boat trip. Great place to hang out with family.
"Best place to spend time and enjoy the lake view
