"The ambiance here is positive and peaceful. You can feel good vibes here. There is parking space paid and free too. You can get lotus outside the temple to offer it to Goddess Mahalaxmi. It’s highway touch, thus you don’t have to reroute much. "
"Nice Temple, It is very neat and clean.The temple is so big but the staff has maintained it really well. You can feel the peace of mind here. "
It is a good place but the administration must look out for proper steps and roof for ease to devotees as it is very hard to go up and down as there are no proper steps. Otherwise good scenes when you reach the final location.
"Neat and clean place. Proper line arrangements depending upon the crowd. There are two different temples, one is at base of mountain and other one at top it mountain."
"This place is in Dahanu Maharashtra,The temple is having a very peacefully environment it just connected to highway NH48 There are shops for flower and sweets mostly crowded on Friday other wise less crowded ."
The divine spritual place of Mata Laxmi.The peace and happiness you get here is totally different.
Very nice and clean temple. A well renowned temple. Ample of space and lot of devotees on special days related to Maa Mahalakshmi. A must visit temple in Charoti. You feel so relaxed.
It is very beautiful temple of Mahalakshmi goddess. It's situated in Dahanu. Far from Dahanu station but share autos are available.
A peaceful place to spend time in the morning. The temple is well managed. Fresh vegetables are available near the temple.
It’s one of the most popular Temples adjacent to NH48 at Dahanu. People from Mumbai/ Maharashtra and Gujarat visit here with a great faith. It’s a divine experience not to be missed. 
"Nice temple located in Dahanu, near by Highway no 48, this place is peaceful, you can go up to the top of mountain and visit the temple too. "
There are two temples in Dahanu on the Western Express Highway. One is at down like other temple and other one is the top of the mountain. Both are extremely nice and spiritual.
Reaching Mahalaxmi temple : nearest railway station is Dahanu Road. From Dahanu west state transport bus from depots.

A huge temple complex with serpentine queue but keeps moving...An exhilarating spiritual experience.
The temple is well maintained and there are clear directions to reach the spot. This was my first visit and i had a great darshan and blessings from Godes Mahalaxmi.
"This Mandir is an important Hindu temple dedicated to Goddess Lakshmi, who resides here as Supreme Mother Mahalakshmi and is worshipped by locals as Ambabai. "
One cannot review a temple ever as its a place of worship and has sentimental importance to visitors.
Visited the temple during a festival but though there was a crowd we got a good darshan. Temple is very nice
A visit to the well maintained Mahalaxmi Temple is a must. be there for 0930hrs Arti in the Morning for Blessings.
